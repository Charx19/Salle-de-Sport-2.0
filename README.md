# Help : How to Submit Changes from a Local Repository :
1. Always perform a `git pull` before `git add` to avoid overwriting others' work.
2. Use `git add .` to stage all changes.
3. Commit your changes with a descriptive message : `git commit -m "Message describing the changes"`
4. Before pushing to the main branch, test your changes and have them reviewed by the team.
5. Push your changes : `git push origin main`
